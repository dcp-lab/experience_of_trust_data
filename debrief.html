<h2>Debrief</h2>
<p><b>Thank you for participating in this experiment.</b></p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to <b>explore how receiving trust in economic interactions impacts individuals' well-being.</b></p>
<p>In particular, we are interested in <b>how being trusted by another person during a decision-making task influences emotional affect and anxiety levels.</b>
<p>You were deliberately assigned the role of <b>Player B</b>, and in each trial you received an amount (tripled) from another participant, simulating a situation of trust. 
  Your responses during the game and in the surveys will help us better understand the psychological effects of trust-based interactions.</p>
<p>All of your responses have been recorded and anonymized. If you have any questions or wish to know more about the study, feel free to contact the research team at <i>dcp-lab@ucl.ac.uk</i>.</p>
<p><b>You may now close the application. Thank you again!</b></p>
